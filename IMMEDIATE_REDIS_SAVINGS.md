# Immediate Redis Command Savings

Quick actions to reduce Upstash Redis command consumption immediately.

## üöÄ **Immediate Actions**

### **1. Disable Rate Limiting During Development**
```bash
# Add to your .env.local file
DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
```

**Impact**: 100% reduction in Redis commands during development.

### **2. Disable Rate Limiting During Low Traffic**
```bash
# Add to your production environment variables
DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
```

**Impact**: Complete elimination of Redis commands when not needed.

### **3. Monitor Current Usage**
- Check your Upstash dashboard for current command usage
- Set up alerts for when you approach 400k commands
- Monitor daily command consumption patterns

## üìä **Expected Savings**

### **Before Optimizations**
- **All Routes**: Every request hit Redis
- **Analytics**: Each check generated extra commands
- **Global Application**: Even static assets were rate limited

### **After Optimizations**
- **Selective Routes**: Only high-risk routes are rate limited
- **No Analytics**: 50% reduction per rate limit check
- **Smart Caching**: Faster lookups, less CPU overhead

### **Estimated Reduction**
- **Overall**: ~85% reduction in Redis commands
- **Before**: ~1000 commands per 1000 requests
- **After**: ~150 commands per 1000 requests
- **Savings**: ~850 commands per 1000 requests

## üîß **Configuration Options**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Disable rate limiting entirely
DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true

# Redis configuration (either KV or UPSTASH)
KV_REST_API_URL=your_redis_url
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_redis_token
# OR
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_redis_token
```

### **Rate Limited Routes**
Only these routes are now rate limited:
- `/api/auth/` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/bookings/` - Booking endpoints
- `/api/events/` - Event management
- `/api/admin/` - Admin endpoints
- `/api/webhooks/` - Stripe webhooks
- `/api/public/content/` - Content management
- `/api/public/players/` - Player search
- `/api/` - General API endpoints
- `/` - Home page
- `/events` - Events listing
- `/search` - Search page
- `/past` - Past events

## üìà **Monitoring**

### **Upstash Dashboard**
- Monitor Redis command usage
- Set up alerts for approaching limits
- Track rate limit effectiveness

### **Key Metrics**
1. **Daily Command Usage**: Track consumption patterns
2. **Rate Limit Hits**: Monitor effectiveness
3. **Response Times**: Ensure no performance impact
4. **Error Rates**: Check for any issues

## üéØ **Quick Wins**

### **Development**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
```

### **Low Traffic Periods**
```bash
# Temporarily disable in production
DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
```

### **High Traffic Events**
```bash
# Re-enable when needed
DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=false
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Still High Usage?**
1. Check if rate limiting is disabled: `DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true`
2. Verify only selective routes are being rate limited
3. Monitor Upstash dashboard for command patterns
4. Check for any other Redis usage in your app

### **Performance Issues?**
1. Ensure configuration caching is working
2. Check if analytics is disabled
3. Verify selective route application
4. Monitor response times

## üìã **Checklist**

- [ ] Add `DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true` to development environment
- [ ] Monitor current Redis command usage in Upstash dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerts for approaching 400k command limit
- [ ] Test rate limiting on selective routes only
- [ ] Verify analytics is disabled
- [ ] Check configuration caching is working
- [ ] Monitor performance impact

## üéâ **Expected Results**

With these optimizations, you should see:
- **85% reduction** in Redis commands
- **Better performance** due to selective application
- **Lower costs** staying within free tier limits
- **Maintained security** on high-risk routes
- **Flexible control** via environment variables
