# Info Popover Implementation Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created InfoPopover Component
- **Location**: `/src/components/forms/form-fields/info-popover.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Clean info icon (ℹ️) that appears next to labels
  - Click to toggle popover with help text
  - Positioned dynamically relative to the icon
  - Click outside to close
  - Accessible with proper ARIA labels
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects

### 2. Updated DynamicField Component
- **Removed**: Direct display of description text below fields
- **Added**: Info icon integration in the label area
- **Logic**: Only shows info icon when `field.description` exists
- **Layout**: Icon appears after the required asterisk (*) if present

### 3. Updated CheckboxField Component
- **Removed**: Inline description text next to checkbox
- **Cleaned up**: Simplified checkbox layout
- **Consistency**: Now uses the same info popover system as other fields

### 4. Updated Exports
- Added `InfoPopover` to the main exports for reusability
- Updated documentation with usage examples

## UI/UX Improvements

### Before
```
Field Label *
[Input Field]
This is a long description that takes up space and clutters the UI
```

### After
```
Field Label * ℹ️
[Input Field]
```
*(Click the ℹ️ icon to see help text in a popover)*

## Benefits

1. **Clean UI**: Removes visual clutter by hiding help text by default
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Users only see help when they need it
3. **Space Efficient**: More compact form layout
4. **Consistent**: Same behavior across all field types
5. **Accessible**: Proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support
6. **Mobile Friendly**: Popovers work well on touch devices

## Usage

The info popover is automatically integrated into all dynamic form fields. Simply provide a `description` property in your field definition:

```tsx
const formFields = [
  {
    name: 'email',
    label: 'Email Address',
    type: 'email',
    required: true,
    description: 'We\'ll use this email to send you booking confirmations and updates'
  },
  {
    name: 'dietary_requirements',
    label: 'Dietary Requirements',
    type: 'textarea',
    required: false,
    description: 'Please list any allergies, dietary restrictions, or special meal requirements'
  }
]
```

The info icon will automatically appear and show the description in a popover when clicked!

## Technical Details

- **Positioning**: Uses `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise positioning
- **Z-index**: Uses `z-50` to ensure popover appears above other content
- **Responsive**: Centered above the icon with arrow pointer
- **Click Outside**: Uses `useRef` and event listeners for proper cleanup
- **Performance**: Only renders popover when open (conditional rendering)
