# TypeScript Guidelines

- Prefer strong typing everywhere; avoid `any`.
- Exported/public APIs should be explicitly typed. Internal variables may rely on inference when clear.
- Avoid unsafe casts; if a cast is required, narrow types first and cast as late as possible.
- Name functions and variables descriptively; prefer full words over abbreviations.
- Keep components small; extract reusable parts into shared components, otherwise colocate within the page folder.
- After edits, fix all ESLint warnings and type errors.
